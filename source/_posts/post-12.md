When people talk about radiation, they don't always know that it is something that is present in our daily routine or that it is also often used in some branches of medicine. The term is usually associated with disasters that have caused several fatalities.

The fear of another accident became real when, on 03/03/2022 [1], during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, bombings hit one of the buildings housing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in operation in Europe. Fortunately, the attack did not hit the reactors and no radioactive material leaked out, but if there had been an explosion, the impact could have been 10 times greater than that of Chernobyl, considered the worst nuclear accident in history, reaching level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) [2].

In figure 1 the accidents are separated by the level of impact caused, but their causes are diverse [3].  See:

# Chernobyl (1986)

The biggest nuclear disaster in history occurred in Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, when a reactor at the plant experienced technical problems, releasing a radioactive cloud containing 70 tons of uranium and 900 tons of graphite into the atmosphere. The accident was responsible for the deaths of more than 2.4 million people in the surrounding area. Animals, rivers and forests were also contaminated and various genetic anomalies occurred in the region.

# Fukushima (2011)

After an earthquake measuring 9 on the Richter scale hit the country, the nuclear power plant in Fukushima suffered damage to three of its six reactors on March 11, 2011. The levels of radiation released were high, causing this disaster to be classified as grade 7 on the International Nuclear Accident Scale (INES).

Due to the magnitude of the disaster at Fukushima, more than 10 years after the accident, the region is still suffering the consequences of the radiation present there.

# Kyshtym (Ozyorsk - 1957)

The Mayak plant suffered a fault in the cooling system of the nuclear waste storage compartment. The error caused an explosion in a tank containing 80 tons of radioactive material.

The gas cloud contaminated the region within a radius of 800 km. Around 10,000 people were evacuated and at least 200 deaths were recorded as a result of radiation exposure. This accident reached level 5 on the International Nuclear Event Scale.

# Windscale (1957)

After the Second World War, England, seeking to develop nuclear weapons and in a hurry to make an atomic bomb, made mistakes that led to a fire in the reactor, leaking radioactive material into the atmosphere. This level 5 accident caused more than 200 cases of cancer.

# Three Mile Island (1979)

The accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant reached level 5 on the International Nuclear Event Scale on March 28, 1979. Located near the capital of Pennsylvania, the plant overheated due to a mechanical problem and did not explode, but released steam and gases.

Although there were no deaths from the radiation, around 25,000 people came into contact with these gases, and the conclusion was reached that “either there will be no cases of cancer or the number will be so small that it will never be possible to detect them.”

# Cesium - 137 (1987)

The level 5 radioactive accident happened in Goiânia in 1987, due to negligence and lack of information. Two paper collectors found an abandoned radiotherapy machine and when they dismantled it, they found a lead capsule with caesium chloride inside, i.e. a highly radioactive material.

The bright color of the cesium chloride in the dark impressed the residents, who distributed “white powder” to family members and neighbors. In all, eleven people died and more than 600 were contaminated. Radiation exposure affected 100,000 people.

# Tokaimura (1999)

100 km from Tokyo, the headquarters of Japan's nuclear industry was the scene of an accident that exposed more than 600 people to high levels of radiation in 1999. Employees of a uranium reprocessing company overdosed on the radioactive metal in a reactor that had been decommissioned for a year, which suffered an uncontrolled reaction and leaked radiation, causing a level 4 accident.

You can see that 5 out of the 7 major radiological accidents occurred due to faults in nuclear power plants.  Are you curious to learn more about nuclear power plants? We'll be doing a post on the subject soon!

And when an accident happens? How are people contaminated?  We'll have a post on that too!
