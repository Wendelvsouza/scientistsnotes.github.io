# Radiation symbol

{% asset_img "radiation.jpg"%}

Created in 1946 at the University of California, Berkeley's radiation laboratory, the general idea of the symbol is: the point in the center represents the radioactive source and each of the 3 blades represents a different radiation - one blade for alpha radiation, one for beta and one for gamma. The color yellow emphasizes danger.
