# Why are Hiroshima and Nagasaki habitable and Chernobyl not?

{% asset_img "hiroshimanagasaki.jpg"%}

Why are Hiroshima and Nagasaki habitable and Chernobyl not? An atomic bomb releases the greatest possible energy from the reaction of a nuclear fission in the shortest possible time, creating the most damage. Therefore, the radioactive isotopes created in an atomic explosion have a relatively short lifespan. A nuclear reactor, on the other hand, wants to produce energy in a slow reaction process, which results in the creation of nuclear waste materials that have a longer life. Thus, the initial radiation from a nuclear accident may be much lower than that from a bomb, but its lifespan will be much longer.
